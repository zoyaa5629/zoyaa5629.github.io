            <h2>Conext</h2>
            <p>In this project we all made a small game. This game would give you choices and you would click on a choice and it would have either good or bad consequences. CYOA stands for Create Your Own Adventure. Students created their own adventure with creative topics and interesting back stories. Students made this project using files and folders in cs50.dev to github where the playable game was.</p>
            
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>In this project my partner was Alex and we had the theme of escaping from school. We worked on <a href="https://cs50.dev/">cs50.dev</a><br> and on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a><br>. We kept in touch with each other on <a href="https://https://slack.com//">slack</a><br> where we discussed possible plan options and helped each other with the code.</p>
            
            <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
            <p>I think the hardest part of this project was coming up with ideas. Me and my partner had a lot of ideas and to me thaat was the hardest part of the project. We didn't want to overdo our work and make it too complicated for us but still make it fun for players. We knew that we wanted the character to start at waking up but from then it got challenging. What will he do after waking up? Jump out the window? Go straight to school? Sleep in? Me and my partner settled on sleeping in and getting up for school to be our first options. From there we took two routes one being going to school or going out shopping or to a friend's place. Me and Alex had trouble deciding on what would give the character a game over or victory. At first we wanted to make the options of going to the mall or friend's house more complicated but we decided that those two options would give the character a victory.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This project was certainly helped me with a better understanding of how to make and use files in SEP. This project has taught me how to work with people you don't really know and aren't familiar with. I really think projects like these help me learn more than just listening to a lesson. I prefer immersive projects like this.[</p>
